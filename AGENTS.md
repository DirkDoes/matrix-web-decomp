The role of this file is to describe common mistakes and confusion points that agents might encounter as they work in this project.

## Developer Notes


## Agent Notes (Surprises Encountered)

### View, Style, And Vector Asset Separation
- Views should stay focused on markup and Rails helpers. Avoid embedding large `<style>` blocks or inline SVG markup in `.erb` templates.
- Page and layout styling belongs in Rails asset stylesheets under `app/assets/stylesheets/`. The logged-in shell/sidebar styles currently live in `app/assets/stylesheets/logged_in.css`; public landing/auth styles live in `app/assets/stylesheets/public_pages.css`.
- Public static vector assets belong under `public/icons/`. The sidebar icons are stored there as separate SVG files and loaded by the layout instead of being written directly into the view.
- Keep custom interactive behavior in JavaScript assets instead of inline scripts when possible. The split verification-code input behavior lives in `app/assets/javascripts/verification_code.js`.
- The authenticated layout keeps navigation structure in `app/views/layouts/settings.html.erb`, but styling and SVG source are separated into their own asset files.
